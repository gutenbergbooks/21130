		<h2 class="section_title"><a class="pagenum" id="page_v" title="v"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
		<p><span class="first_word">Cynics</span> may ask, how many have profited by
			the innumerable proverbs and maxims of
			prudence which have been current in the world
			time out of mind? They will say that their only
			use is to repeat them after some unhappy wight
			has “gone wrong.” When, for instance, a man has
			played “ducks and drakes” with his money, the
			fact at once calls up the proverb which declares
			that “wilful waste leads to woful want”; but did not
			the “waster” know this well-worn saying from
			his early years <em>downwards</em>? What good, then, did
			it do him? Again, how many have been benefited
			by the saying of the ancient Greek poet, that
			“evil communications corrupt good manners”?—albeit
			they had it frequently before them in their
			school “copy-books.” Are the maxims of morality
			useless, then, because they are so much disregarded?</p>
		<p>When a man has reached middle-age he generally
			feels with tenfold force the truth of those “sayings
			of the wise” which he learned in his early years, and
			has cause to regret, as well as wonder, that he had
			not all along followed their wholesome teaching.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page_vi" title="vi"></a>For it is to the young, who are about to cross
			the threshold of active life, that such terse convincing
			sentences are more especially addressed, and, spite
			of the proverbial heedlessness of youth, there will
			be found many who are not deaf to this kind of
			instruction, if their moral environment be favourable.
			But, even after the spring-time of youth is past,
			there are occasions when the mind is peculiarly
			susceptible to the force of a pithy maxim, which
			may tend to the reforming of one’s way of life.
			There is commonly more practical wisdom in a
			striking aphorism than in a round dozen of “goody”
			books—that is to say, books which are not good
			in the highest sense, because their themes are
			overlaid with commonplace and wearisome reflections.</p>
		<p>May we not find the “whole duty of man”
			condensed into a few brief sentences, which have
			been expressed by thoughtful men in all ages and in
			countries far apart?—such as: “Love thy neighbour
			as thyself,” “Do unto others as ye would that they
			should do unto you.” The chief themes of all
			teachers of morality are: benevolence and beneficence;
			tolerance of the opinions of others; self-control; the
			acquisition of knowledge—that jewel beyond price;
			the true uses of wealth; the advantages of resolute,
			manly exertion; the dignity of labour; the futility
			of worldly pleasures; the fugacity of time; man’s
			individual insignificance. They are never weary of
			inculcating taciturnity in preference to loquacity, and
			the virtues of patience and resignation. They iterate
			and reiterate the fact that true happiness is to be
			found only in contentment; and they administer consolation
			and infuse hope by reminding us that as
			dark days are followed by bright days, so times of
			bitter adversity are followed by seasons of sweet
			<a class="pagenum" id="page_vii" title="vii"></a>prosperity; and thus, like the immortal Sir Hudibras,
			when “in doleful dumps”, we may “cheer ourselves
			with ends of verse, and sayings of philosophers.”</p>
		<p>In the following small selection of aphorisms,
			a considerable proportion are drawn from Eastern
			literature. Indian wisdom is represented by passages
			from the great epics, the <i>Mahābhārata</i> and the
			<i>Rāmāyana</i>; the <i>Panchatantra</i> and the <i>Hitopadesa</i>,
			two Sanskrit versions of the famous collection of
			apologues known in Europe as the Fables of Bidpaï,
			or Pilpay; the <i>Dharma-sastra</i> of Manu; Bhāravi,
			Māgha, Bhartrihari, and other Hindu poets. Specimens
			of the mild teachings of Buddha and his more
			notable followers are taken from the <i>Dhammapada</i>
			(Path of Virtue) and other canonical works; pregnant
			sayings of the Jewish Fathers, from the Talmud;
			Moslem moral philosophy is represented by extracts
			from Arabic and Persian writers (among the great
			poets of Persia are, Firdausī, Sa’dī, Hāfiz, Nizāmī,
			Omar Khayyām, Jāmī); while the proverbial wisdom
			of the Chinese and the didactic writings of the
			sages of Burmah are also occasionally cited.</p>
		<p>The ordinary reader will probably be somewhat
			surprised to discover in the aphorisms of the ancient
			Greeks and Hindus several close parallels to the
			doctrines of the Old and New Testaments, and he
			will have reasoned justly if he conclude that the
			so-called “heathens” could have derived their spiritual
			light only from the same Source as that which
			inspired the Hebrew prophets and the Christian
			apostles.</p>
		<p>Among English writers of aphorisms Francis
			Bacon, Lord Verulam, is pre-eminent, but none
			of his pithy sentences find place here, because
			they are procurable in many inexpensive forms,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page_viii" title="viii"></a>(<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Counsels from my Lord Bacon</i>, 1892), and
			must be familiar to what is termed “the average
			general reader.” <i>The Enchiridion</i> of Frances Quarles
			and the <i>Resolves</i> of Owen Feltham are, however,
			laid under contribution, as also Robert Chamberlain,
			an author who is probably unknown to many
			pluming themselves on their thorough acquaintance
			with English literature, some of whose aphorisms
			(published in 1638, under the title of <i>Nocturnal
			Lucubrations</i>) I have deemed worthy of reproduction.</p>
		<p>In more modern times, with the sole exception
			of William Hazlitt, our country has produced no very
			successful writer of aphorisms. Colton’s <i>Lacon;
			or, Many Things in Few Words, Addressed to
			Those who Think</i>, went through several editions
			soon after its first publication in 1820; it is
			described by Mr. John Morley—and not unfairly—as
			being “so vapid, so wordy, so futile as to have
			a place among those books which dispense with
			parody”; it is “an awful example to anyone who
			is tempted to try his hand at an aphorism.”
			Mr. Morley is hardly less severe in speaking of the
			“Thoughts” in <i>Theophrastus Such</i>: “the most
			insufferable of all deadly-lively prosing in our sublunary
			world.” However this may be, assuredly other
			works of the author of <i>Adam Bede</i> will be found
			to furnish many examples of admirable apothegms.</p>
		<p>It only remains to add that, bearing in mind
			that a great collection of gravities commonly proves
			quite as wearisome reading as a large compilation
			of gaieties, or facetiæ, I have confined my selection
			of “sayings of the wise” within the limits of a
			pocket-volume.</p>
